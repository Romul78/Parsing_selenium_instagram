* Program for downloading photos from instagram - Python + Selenium.
* This is my test project for scraping web pages with Selenium. After starting, log in and enter the nickname of the object from which you want to download a photo. Then you will have to wait for some time (depending on the number of photos). The program goes through several cycles, refreshing and scrolling down the page, then cleans up duplicates and downloads to your computer.
