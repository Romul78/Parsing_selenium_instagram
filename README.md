* Program for downloading photos from instagram - Python + Selenium.
* This is my test project for web scraping with Selenium. After starting, enter the password and nickname of the object from which you want to download a     photo. Then you will have to wait for some time (depending on the number of photos). The program goes through several cycles, updating and scrolling down   the page, then cleans up duplicates and downloads to your computer.
